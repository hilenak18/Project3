            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p> I am a juinor year student at Kennesaw State Universite majoring in IT. I was born in Addis Ababa the capital city of Ethiopia. I came here when I was nine years old and Georgia was my home since then. Growing up, I was always curious about computers and how they manage to give us information we want.</p> <p>This curiosity led me continue my education after high school. Choosing a colloge was not hard for me at the moment 
                , I knew staying far from home is the toughest thing to do. So, KSU became my first choose. I want to say my first semester was a struggle for me. This may be because I am the first person in my family to attend colloge.</p> <p>I pretty much had to figure everything out on my own. 
                I had in mind to have a dorm with clean  twin bed, study table, and roommates. However, I was in long wait list. I eventually found a one bedroom avaliable outside campus last minute and everthing I knew since then went really fast. I had to work to pay off my living and transportion.</p> <p>This made it ten times harder
                for me as I am trying to be a regular student. Moving forward, I begin to slowly get the system and mange my time. My goal honestly is to graduate and able to put in a hard and fun work for better world. I would like to also be my own boss which I am hoping one 
                day I could open a business that will last for my generation. Outside of work, I would like to travel and visit my country and share my expreince about America and give opportunities for individuals.
